# ABQStumbler

##Description
ABQ Stumbler is a web application focused on pedestrian safety and education. The App includes multiple functionalities to keep ABQ pedestrians safe. ABQ Stumbler users can report issues regarding obstructions, accessibility, maintenance, or infrastructure.

Education and vigilance are some of the most important factors for pedestrian safety. To ensure that pedestrians are safe, we would like to continue to develop an awareness of the application as well as gather new information to keep pedestrians safe.

We have developed the framework for the site as well and added some relevant pedestrian accident data to the site. All the databases and back end are in place, but some functionality such as forms are necessary to complete the fundamental portions of the application.
 We are building the application using Laravel, Bootstrap, and MySQL. Any development help with these technologies would be great. You can view the current code on the Code for ABQ repository on GitHub.

Another important aspect where we will need help is with the education page. If you have any tips or information on how to keep pedestrians safer we can add it to the main education page.

This app can be used by both pedestrians and drivers to figure out how to keep ABQ safe! Tell commuters you know about this app to make ABQ more pedestrian friendly!
