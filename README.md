# ABQStumbler

ABQ Stumbler is focused on pedestrian safety. This includes functionality to add the location of a past pedestrian incident. ABQ Stumbler would allow users to contribute additional information such as "flagging" incidents as obstruction, accessibility issue, maintenance, or infrastructure issue.
In addition to simply collecting the data, ABQ Stumbler could be educational or serve as a "dashboard" for all things Pedestrian Safety related.
